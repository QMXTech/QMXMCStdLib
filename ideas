Endpoint needs "adapter" (wireless or wired) -> also needs network assoc. card

Networks need a network configuration terminal for proper association; uses network association cards

Energized Microfiber Conduit Networks -> needs a fiber-making machine

Endpoint faces need configurable channel card, which allows for bundles; filters are optionally in channel card; configurable via network config. terminal
